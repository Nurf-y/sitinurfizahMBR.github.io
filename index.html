    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I’m someone who enjoys working with structure while staying flexible when things change.
        I pick things up quickly, stay organized, and can be relied on to follow through on what
        needs to be done. I care about doing things accurately and efficiently, whether I’m
        working on my own or collaborating with a team.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve had experience across customer service, logistics, technical support, and media
        coordination. In these roles, I supported daily operations, managed documentation, and
        helped teams keep workflows running smoothly. I’m comfortable working under pressure and
        prefer to focus on practical, clear solutions when challenges come up.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m looking for a space where I can contribute steadily, keep learning new skills, and
        add value through consistent and dependable work.
